### Hi, I'm Joshua Hasinski ðŸ‘‹

I am a systems designer from Northeast Ohio, driven by a passion for bringing complex conceptual worlds to life. For the past three years, I have been singularly focused on architecting, documenting, and performing rigorous quality assurance on a large-scale personal project, which has allowed me to develop a deep, practical expertise in the entire system life cycle, from initial design to long-term viability testing.
